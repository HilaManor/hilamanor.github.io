# Hila Manor

Hi, I'm Hila,  a PhD student at the [Electrical and Computer Engineering department](https://ece.technion.ac.il/) of the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/),
under the supervission of [Prof. Tomer Mihcaeli](https://tomer.net.technion.ac.il/).

My research interests lie in the field of deep learning, with a focus on generative models. I am particularly interested in exploring their applications, interpretability, and reliability.

If you're interested in collaboration, feel free to reach out to me at `hila dot manor at campus dot technion dot ac dot il`.
